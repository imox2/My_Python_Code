**Want to find circular prime till one million.**

**Not finished, a work in progress.**

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

The code runs correct, but is messy and slow. Will work to make it fast and more pythonic.
