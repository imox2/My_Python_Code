This repo is a place where I store my Python code (or intend to store in future).

Each Python code has a filename with .py extension (I know that you know that) and that file has an adjoint documentaion
file in docs/filename from where we could find the intended aim of the code. 

The bigger python project code will have its own repo. This repo is for mainly small python script.
